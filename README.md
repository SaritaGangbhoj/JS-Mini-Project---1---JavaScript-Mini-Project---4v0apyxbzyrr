# Description
a. WHY this project was chosen (what use case does it solve)
- To train myself in the area using languages such as HTML, CSS & JS through methodologies such as css grid, flex and creation of websites.

b. HOW did you make the project (Tech Stack, Database, APIs)
- Created a boilerplate for the title Starbucks Coffee Company of the website. I have used HTML tags for creating the structure and CSS for styling the content. Used CSS grid for all the blocks and flexbox for the menu making. Created a responsive hamburger menu icon, used JS to add and remove the hidden class. For making site responsive used media queries. So I have a responsive starbucks website.
